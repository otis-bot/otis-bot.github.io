# About the Website
The Otis website was created with the <a href="https://github.com/st4ple/solid-jekyll">solid-jekyll</a> theme designed by blacktie.co. The site was made to serve as a soft landing page for those interested in the Otis-Bot Project. 

# Otis-Bot Project
Otis-Bot is an Otis project, built and maintained by students and graduates of the Firehose Project. Otis-Bot is based on Hubot and written in Node.js/CoffeeScript.

The purpose of the bot is to scrape Slack for potentially informative and helpful URLs posted by the participants of the community. When the bot 'hears' a URL posted (based on a regular expression test), it attempts to POST to an API server that is charged with storing and maintaining the URLs.
