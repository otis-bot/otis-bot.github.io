                <h4>Otis Bot</h4>
                <p>Otis-Bot is based on Hubot and written in Node.js/CoffeeScript. The purpose of the bot is to scrape Slack forums for potentially informative and helpful URLs posted by Slack's community participants. When the bot 'hears' the posting of a URL, it sends a POST to an API server that stores and maintains the URLs.</p>

                <h4>Front-end</h4>
                <p>The Front-end (built with ES6, React, Redux, and Webpack) displays scraped URLs posted by Slack community participants. The bot 'listens' for and 'hears' a posted URL (using a regular expression test) and sends a POST request to the API server, which stores and maintains the URL for later use. The Front-end can later retrieve the URL through a GET request.</p>

                <h4>Backend</h4>
                <p>Otis Backend is the backend portion of the Otis-Bot. The Backend receives URLs from the Otis-Bot, storing and maintaining the URLs so they can be delivered later. Otis Backend provides an API for the front-end application, which allows Slack community participants to vote and comment on the usefulness of the links saved by Otis-Bot.</p>
